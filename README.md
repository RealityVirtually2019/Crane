Crane is a design language used for 6DoF XR interactions, inspired by traditional origami style.

Our XR interface utilizes the space surrounding the user. It’s not necessary to have a lot of space to navigate through XR, especially when we are using our hands as controllers and cannot reach too far away.

The visual style and the interaction feedback in today’s XR sometimes feel inconsistent. With a systematic design language, we can unify the experience and make it even more intuitive.

Crane uses a set of interfaces and interactions that inherit & simulate origami.

Our goal is to make the experience in XR robust, tangible & intuitive.
